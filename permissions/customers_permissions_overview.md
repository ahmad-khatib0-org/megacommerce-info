## ✅ **When "Permissions" Are Meaningful for Customers**

For **admin users**, it's expected to manage permissions like `CREATE_PRODUCT`, `EDIT_USER`,
etc. But for **customers**, it’s nuanced. Here's how to think about it:

### 1. **Core Permissions vs Behavioral Rules**

| Type                     | Example                                                        | Explanation                                                                                           |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Hard Permission       | `can_place_order = false`                                      | Rare, but could be used for blacklisted users, fraud prevention, or bans.                             |
| ⚖️ Dynamic Business Rule | _"If canceled 3 orders in 24h, disable ordering temporarily.”_ | This is behavioral logic, **not a permission**, and is enforced in backend logic, often outside RBAC. |
| 🎚 Feature Flag          | _"Can access new cart experience"_                             | Toggle feature availability via a flagging system (like LaunchDarkly or Unleash).                     |

## 🧠 So Why List “Place Order” as a Permission?

That depends on how **flexible** or **admin-controllable** you want your system to be.

### 🎯 **3 Valid Scenarios Where These Make Sense:**

#### 1. **Custom Plans or Tiers**

E.g., imagine customers on different plans or under promotional experiments:

- Free users cannot place more than 5 orders/day.
- Certain B2B customers can bypass minimum quantity checks.
- Beta testers have early access to bulk ordering.

> ✅ These can be toggled as flags or fine-grained permissions.

#### 2. **Abuse Prevention / Moderation**

If your trust team wants to **ban or restrict** certain users dynamically:

- Mark customer as `can_place_orders = false`
- Disallow reviews: `can_post_review = false`

> ✅ This would be enforced like a permission, controlled by moderation logic.

#### 3. **Multi-tenant / B2B Portals**

In marketplaces with **multiple clients**:

- Each organization may customize what its "customers" can do.
- You could enable or disable specific features per client/customer group.

> ✅ Now permissions become powerful for segmentation and control.

## ✅ Summary: How to Design It Smartly

### ✳️ Use RBAC When:

- You want **explicit, managed control** over user capabilities.
- It’s **customer class or tenant-specific**.
- You’ll be toggling access frequently or dynamically.

### 🔁 Use Backend Logic (Not Permissions) When:

- You want to enforce business rules like rate limiting or fraud mitigation.
- These rules are **not user-controlled** and are based on actions/metrics.

### 🚀 Combine with Feature Flags:

For things like:

- Early access to features
- UX experiments
- AB testing

## 🔧 Real-World Approach (like in Amazon, Shopify, etc.)

- Customer has basic permissions like:

  - `can_review`, `can_checkout`, `can_contact_support`, etc.

- Everything else is **policy-based logic** or **behavioral rules**.
- Moderation systems may “demote” abusive customers by toggling off key permissions.

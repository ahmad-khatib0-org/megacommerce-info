## 💡 Advanced Ideas

- 🔐 Use a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system with custom roles per supplier.
- 🧩 Allow “composable roles” (like Shopify) — combine individual permissions into role templates.
- 🔁 Allow suppliers to create **scoped roles** for contributors (e.g., “Image Editor”, “Promotions Manager”).
- 🚥 Feature flags can control access to:

  - Advanced Analytics
  - Beta Features
  - A/B Testing Tools
  - AI-based Product Suggestions
  - Experimental UIs

- 📊 Use an admin permission dashboard for assigning and revoking access with **activity logs**.
